Feel free to modify, use, change, market, do whatever you want with it as long as you give the appropriate credit where credit is due (which means giving the authors the credit they deserve for writing it). 

Also note that by using this software, if you ever see the creator of SET in a bar, you should (optional) give him a hug and should (optional) buy him a beer (or bourbon - hopefully bourbon). Author has the option to refuse the hug (most likely will never happen) or the beer or bourbon (also most likely will never happen). Also by using this tool (these are all optional of course!), you should try to make this industry better, try to stay positive, try to help others, try to learn from one another, try stay out of drama, try offer free hugs when possible (and make sure recipient agrees to mutual hug), and try to do everything you can to be awesome.
