web.py - Core module for web-based services bruteforce.

Category: Core
Description:
    This module provides the methods for bruteforcing web-based services.
    Most of these are built upon the Selenium library for webscraping and manipulation.
    These include:
    - facebook
    - instagram
    - twitter

    These are some of the more common web services that have presented vulnerabilities in
    their authentication in the past. NOTE that rate-limiting may be present within their
    respective login forms, so timeouts delays are reinforced.

Dependencies: selenium
